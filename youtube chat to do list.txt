as with raid_ids, add comments also to a file, so that when reloading, it shows the original time stamps - done
    just make sure, that it doesn't just fill up the files endlessly, if the script sees that the file is from a day ago, it makes a new file (don't have to delete the old files)

I want all the messages with their time stamps saved to a file, also needs to save the message IDs - done (didn't have to write IDs in the same file)

the messages in chat_messages.txt don't get written/read in the proper order - done
    expected behaviour: when restarting the chat script, the messages are ordered based on their time stamps
    this only works for messages send in a single day, or you will have to also write the unix time too
    unix time might actually be a better way to do it, from the unix time you can then also derive the timestamps
    and don't have to save them as strings separately

save chat_messages.txt and chat_ids.txt per date, so it doesn't load the one from last stream - done

have name exchange list in a file - done

- figure out how to deal with deleted messages
    currently the script just breaks when a message gets deleted
        no it doesn't, probably because all the messages get saved now
    expected behaviour: the script continues and messages get deleted out of chat_messages.txt
    and deleted from the console (might have to clear console/restart console and read messages from file again)
        can't just delete a single line in the console, would have to do a console clear

- use pygame for the loop and pygame_gui for a UI where you can add URLs, blocked words, name exchange, commands
	reload button, to quickly reload the chrome session, if it breaks - done
	fix start stop bug (after stopping, cannot be started again) - done
	text field for stream link (gets truncated to just the ID) - done
	think of more, like styling parameters or login, once that's done

- make UI for the chat, so you have an option to not just have in inside the console
	when displaying the messages on a screen, make sure to keep their msg_id with them, so that when a message gets deleted it can also be deleted from the chat interface and not be shown anymore

- check if you can open the files at the start of the script once and then close them at the end, so you don't have to open and close them every single time
	see what's more efficient

make clicking on things work - done
	make commands work - done
		need login for that
		save login data in separate file, so it doesn't show in main file
	make login work - done
	make better timestamps work - done

-- use a different browser than chrome, something very very lightweight

- current timestamps are sorted incorrectly
	you need to add a in front oh all the hours 0-9

- add @ to commands
